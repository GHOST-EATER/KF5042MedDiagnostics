## Artificial Intelligence in Medical Diagnostics: The Suitability of Support Vector Machines for Cell Nuclei Classification
### Jack Hunter, w19011677

Code and data for a Support Vector Machine (SVM) and a Decision tree (DT) used in classifying cell nuclei

Code labelled as SVMBest_train and DTBest_train is the training code for the best performing models in the experiments

All code has been auto-generated by MATLAB's Classification Learner Toolbox. The Wisconsin Breast Cancer (Diagnostic) Dataset has been sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository
